# STC-CapsNet: Detecting Audio Deepfakes with Spatio-Temporal Convolutions and Capsule Networks

This repository contains the implementation of the paper **"STC-CapsNet: Detecting Audio Deepfakes with Spatio-Temporal Convolutions and Capsule Networks"**.

## Repository Structure
- `code/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for preprocessing and model implementation.
- `data/`: Placeholder for datasets (not included for copyright reasons).
- `results/`: Results of the model evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `LICENSE`: Licensing information.

## Features
- Preprocessing of audio data (noise reduction, silence removal).
- Feature extraction using mel-spectrograms and grayscale spectrograms.
- Implementation of Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Capsule Network (STC-CapsNet).

## Requirements
To install the required Python packages, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
